Install Processing on your system.

To run:
1. WindClothSimulation.pde: Simply press the 'Play' button
2. TestingMovingSphere.pde: Simply press the 'Play' button and then use mouse cursor to change the location of the sphere and repeatedly press '+' or '-' to change the 'Z-axis' position of the sphere
3. Sim_3D_Cloth.pde: Simply press the 'Play' button
4. DropClothOnSphere.pde: Simply press the 'Play' button
5. CutSimCloth.pde: Simply press the 'Play' button and then press 'a' to cut the cloth in half at any point of time. Note that this will work only once so please restart the simulation to try cutting more number of times.

By default, I have included all the libraries they require to run in the respective folders itself, so they should work without explicitly installing 'toxiclibs'. In case they don't work, you would need to install 'toxiclibs' by going to the following link: http://toxiclibs.org/downloads/
